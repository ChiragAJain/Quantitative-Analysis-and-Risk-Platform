STOCK MARKET ANALYSIS DASHBOARD - FINANCIAL METRICS Q&A
================================================================================

This document provides detailed explanations of all financial metrics, methodologies,
and quantitative choices used in the stock market analysis dashboard.

================================================================================
SECTION 1: RISK METRICS
================================================================================

Q1: What is the Sharpe Ratio and why do we use it?
A1: The Sharpe Ratio measures risk-adjusted returns by calculating excess return per 
    unit of volatility. Formula: (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Volatility
    
    WHY WE USE IT:
    - Standardizes performance comparison across different assets
    - Accounts for risk taken to achieve returns
    - Industry standard for portfolio evaluation
    - Values >1.0 considered good, >2.0 excellent
    
    INTERPRETATION:
    - Higher Sharpe = better risk-adjusted performance
    - Negative Sharpe = returns below risk-free rate
    - Allows comparison between stocks with different volatility profiles

Q2: Why do we use the 10-Year Treasury as the risk-free rate?
A2: The 10-Year Treasury yield represents the "risk-free" return because:
    
    REASONS FOR CHOICE:
    - Backed by U.S. government (virtually no default risk)
    - Highly liquid market with continuous pricing
    - Matches typical investment horizons (not too short/long)
    - Industry standard benchmark used by professionals
    
    CURRENT VALUE (2024/2025): ~4.0-4.5%
    - Reflects current Fed policy and inflation expectations
    - Much higher than 2010s era (0.5-2.5%)
    - Dynamic fetching ensures real-time accuracy
    
    ALTERNATIVE RATES CONSIDERED:
    - 3-Month Treasury: Too short-term for equity analysis
    - Fed Funds Rate: Policy rate, not market-determined
    - Corporate bonds: Not truly "risk-free"

Q3: What is Value at Risk (VaR) and why use 95% confidence?
A3: VaR estimates the maximum expected loss over a specific time period at a given 
    confidence level.
    
    95% CONFIDENCE CHOICE:
    - Standard in risk management (regulatory requirement for banks)
    - Balances between being too conservative (99%) and too liberal (90%)
    - Means 5% chance of exceeding the VaR loss on any given day
    - Allows for "tail risk" while maintaining practical utility
    
    CALCULATION METHOD:
    - Uses historical simulation (percentile method)
    - Based on actual return distribution, not normal assumption
    - More accurate for stocks with skewed return patterns
    
    INTERPRETATION:
    - VaR of -3% means 5% chance of losing more than 3% in one day
    - Higher absolute VaR = riskier investment
    - Used for position sizing and risk budgeting

Q4: How is Maximum Drawdown calculated and why is it important?
A4: Maximum Drawdown measures the largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value.
    
    CALCULATION:
    - Track cumulative returns over time
    - Find maximum value achieved (peak)
    - Measure largest subsequent decline (trough)
    - Express as percentage: (Trough - Peak) / Peak
    
    IMPORTANCE:
    - Shows worst-case historical scenario
    - Indicates potential for large losses
    - Helps assess psychological tolerance for losses
    - Key metric for institutional investors
    
    TYPICAL VALUES:
    - Conservative portfolios: 5-15%
    - Growth stocks: 20-50%
    - Volatile stocks (like Tesla): 50%+
    
    INTERPRETATION:
    - Lower drawdown = more stable investment
    - High drawdown stocks need strong conviction to hold

Q5: What is Beta and how do we calculate it?
A5: Beta measures a stock's sensitivity to market movements (systematic risk).
    
    CALCULATION:
    - Beta = Covariance(Stock, Market) / Variance(Market)
    - Uses S&P 500 (SPY) as market proxy
    - Based on daily returns over 2-year period
    - Requires minimum 20 observations for reliability
    
    INTERPRETATION:
    - Beta = 1.0: Moves with market
    - Beta > 1.0: More volatile than market (e.g., Tesla β ≈ 2.0)
    - Beta < 1.0: Less volatile than market (e.g., Utilities β ≈ 0.7)
    - Beta < 0: Moves opposite to market (rare for stocks)
    
    USES:
    - Portfolio risk assessment
    - Expected return calculations (CAPM)
    - Hedging strategies
    - Sector rotation decisions

================================================================================
SECTION 2: RETURN METRICS
================================================================================

Q6: Why do we annualize returns and volatility?
A6: Annualization standardizes metrics for comparison across different time periods.
    
    METHODOLOGY:
    - Daily returns → Annual: Multiply by 252 (trading days)
    - Daily volatility → Annual: Multiply by √252
    - Assumes returns are independent (random walk)
    
    WHY 252 DAYS:
    - Average trading days per year (365 - weekends - holidays)
    - Industry standard for equity markets
    - More accurate than using 365 for stock analysis
    
    BENEFITS:
    - Enables comparison with annual benchmarks
    - Standard format for reporting to investors
    - Facilitates portfolio allocation decisions
    - Matches typical investment planning horizons

Q7: What is the difference between Total Return and Annualized Return?
A7: Both measure performance but over different time horizons.
    
    TOTAL RETURN:
    - Cumulative return over entire analysis period
    - Formula: (Ending Price - Starting Price) / Starting Price
    - Shows actual historical performance
    - Period-dependent (2-year total ≠ 1-year total)
    
    ANNUALIZED RETURN:
    - Geometric average return per year
    - Formula: (1 + Daily Return)^252 - 1
    - Standardized for comparison
    - Independent of measurement period
    
    EXAMPLE:
    - Stock gains 44% over 2 years
    - Total Return = 44%
    - Annualized Return ≈ 20% per year

Q8: How do we calculate Win Rate and why is it useful?
A8: Win Rate measures the percentage of days with positive returns.
    
    CALCULATION:
    - Count days with positive returns
    - Divide by total trading days
    - Express as percentage
    
    TYPICAL VALUES:
    - Market average: ~52-55%
    - Growth stocks: Often lower (45-50%) but larger wins
    - Defensive stocks: Higher (55-60%) but smaller wins
    
    LIMITATIONS:
    - Doesn't account for magnitude of wins/losses
    - High win rate with small wins < Low win rate with large wins
    - Should be combined with other metrics
    
    USES:
    - Psychological assessment of investment experience
    - Trading strategy evaluation
    - Risk tolerance assessment

================================================================================
SECTION 3: PORTFOLIO METRICS
================================================================================

Q9: What is the Diversification Ratio and why is it important?
A9: Diversification Ratio measures the risk reduction benefit from portfolio diversification.
    
    CALCULATION:
    - Weighted Average Individual Volatilities / Portfolio Volatility
    - Values > 1.0 indicate diversification benefit
    - Higher values = better diversification
    
    INTERPRETATION:
    - Ratio of 1.5 means portfolio is 50% less risky than individual stocks
    - Perfect correlation → Ratio = 1.0 (no diversification)
    - Zero correlation → Maximum diversification benefit
    
    IMPORTANCE:
    - Quantifies "free lunch" of diversification
    - Helps optimize portfolio construction
    - Validates asset allocation decisions
    - Key metric for risk management

Q10: How do we calculate portfolio-level metrics with equal weighting?
A10: Equal weighting assumes each stock has the same portfolio allocation.
    
    METHODOLOGY:
    - Each stock weight = 1/N (where N = number of stocks)
    - Portfolio return = Σ(Weight × Stock Return)
    - Portfolio volatility uses correlation matrix
    
    WHY EQUAL WEIGHTING:
    - Simplifies analysis and comparison
    - Avoids market cap bias
    - Provides baseline for optimization
    - Common academic approach
    
    ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED:
    - Market cap weighting (like S&P 500)
    - Risk parity weighting
    - Optimization-based weighting
    
    LIMITATIONS:
    - May not reflect real-world portfolios
    - Ignores company size differences
    - Requires frequent rebalancing

================================================================================
SECTION 4: CORRELATION ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Q11: How do we interpret correlation coefficients?
A11: Correlation measures linear relationship strength between two variables.
    
    SCALE INTERPRETATION:
    - +1.0: Perfect positive correlation
    - +0.7 to +0.9: Strong positive correlation
    - +0.3 to +0.7: Moderate positive correlation
    - -0.3 to +0.3: Weak/no correlation
    - -0.3 to -0.7: Moderate negative correlation
    - -0.7 to -0.9: Strong negative correlation
    - -1.0: Perfect negative correlation
    
    PORTFOLIO IMPLICATIONS:
    - High correlation (>0.8): Limited diversification benefit
    - Low correlation (<0.3): Good diversification
    - Negative correlation: Natural hedge
    
    TYPICAL STOCK CORRELATIONS:
    - Same sector: 0.6-0.9 (e.g., Apple-Microsoft: ~0.75)
    - Different sectors: 0.2-0.6 (e.g., Tesla-J&J: ~0.35)
    - Market stress: Correlations increase (approach 1.0)

Q12: Why do we use Pearson correlation instead of other measures?
A12: Pearson correlation is the standard for linear relationships in finance.
    
    ADVANTAGES:
    - Measures linear relationships (most common in finance)
    - Scale-invariant (works with different price levels)
    - Well-understood by practitioners
    - Basis for modern portfolio theory
    
    LIMITATIONS:
    - Only captures linear relationships
    - Sensitive to outliers
    - Assumes normal distribution
    
    ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED:
    - Spearman (rank correlation): Better for non-linear
    - Kendall's Tau: More robust to outliers
    - Mutual Information: Captures non-linear dependencies
    
    WHY PEARSON FOR THIS PROJECT:
    - Standard in equity analysis
    - Compatible with portfolio optimization
    - Expected by financial professionals

================================================================================
SECTION 5: STOCK-SPECIFIC INSIGHTS
================================================================================

Q13: What can we infer about current stock performance and characteristics?

TECHNOLOGY STOCKS (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, NVDA):
- HIGH CORRELATION: 0.6-0.8 (move together)
- HIGH VOLATILITY: 25-40% annualized
- HIGH BETA: 1.2-2.0 (more volatile than market)
- GROWTH CHARACTERISTICS: High returns but high risk

TESLA (TSLA):
- HIGHEST VOLATILITY: Often 50%+ annualized
- HIGHEST BETA: ~2.0 (twice as volatile as market)
- EXTREME DRAWDOWNS: Can exceed 50%
- UNIQUE CORRELATION: Lower correlation with other stocks

AMAZON (AMZN):
- MODERATE CORRELATION: 0.5-0.7 with tech stocks
- HIGH VOLATILITY: 30-40%
- CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY: Sensitive to economic cycles

TRADITIONAL STOCKS (JPM, JNJ):
- LOWER VOLATILITY: 15-25%
- LOWER BETA: 0.8-1.2
- DEFENSIVE CHARACTERISTICS: More stable during downturns
- DIVIDEND YIELD: Provides income component

NETFLIX (NFLX):
- MEDIA/ENTERTAINMENT SECTOR: Unique risk profile
- MODERATE CORRELATION: 0.4-0.6 with tech
- SUBSCRIPTION MODEL: Different revenue characteristics

Q14: What market insights can we derive from the correlation matrix?

SECTOR CLUSTERING:
- Technology stocks cluster together (high correlation)
- Traditional sectors (healthcare, finance) show lower correlation
- Diversification benefits exist across sectors

MARKET REGIME INSIGHTS:
- During bull markets: Correlations moderate (0.4-0.7)
- During bear markets: Correlations increase (0.7-0.9)
- Crisis periods: Almost all correlations approach 1.0

PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION INSIGHTS:
- Pure tech portfolio: Limited diversification (high correlation)
- Mixed sector portfolio: Better risk reduction
- International diversification: Would further reduce correlation

Q15: How do current Sharpe ratios compare and what do they indicate?

TYPICAL SHARPE RATIO RANGES (based on current analysis):
- EXCELLENT (>1.5): Rare, indicates superior risk-adjusted returns
- GOOD (1.0-1.5): Solid performance, beating risk-free rate efficiently
- ACCEPTABLE (0.5-1.0): Positive but modest risk-adjusted returns
- POOR (<0.5): Barely beating risk-free rate for risk taken
- NEGATIVE (<0): Losing money relative to risk-free alternative

CURRENT MARKET CONTEXT (2024/2025):
- Higher risk-free rate (4.5%) makes positive Sharpe ratios harder
- Many stocks may show lower Sharpe ratios than historical averages
- Quality stocks still maintain positive Sharpe ratios
- Growth stocks may struggle with current rate environment

================================================================================
SECTION 6: METHODOLOGY CHOICES
================================================================================

Q16: Why do we use 2 years of historical data?
A16: Two years provides optimal balance between relevance and statistical reliability.
    
    ADVANTAGES:
    - Sufficient observations: ~500 trading days
    - Recent enough: Reflects current market conditions
    - Captures full business cycles: Includes various market conditions
    - Statistical reliability: Adequate for correlation/volatility estimates
    
    ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED:
    - 1 Year: Too short for reliable statistics
    - 5 Years: May include outdated market regimes
    - 10 Years: Includes pre-COVID, different Fed policy
    
    TRADE-OFFS:
    - Longer periods: More stable but less relevant
    - Shorter periods: More relevant but less reliable

Q17: Why do we normalize prices to base 100?
A17: Normalization enables fair comparison across stocks with different price levels.
    
    BENEFITS:
    - Equal starting point: All stocks start at 100
    - Percentage-based: Shows relative performance
    - Visual clarity: Easy to compare on same chart
    - Portfolio simulation: Shows equal-weighted performance
    
    CALCULATION:
    - Normalized Price = (Current Price / Starting Price) × 100
    - Starting price becomes baseline (100)
    - All subsequent prices show percentage change
    
    INTERPRETATION:
    - 120 = 20% gain from start
    - 80 = 20% loss from start
    - Slope indicates return rate

Q18: Why do we focus on daily returns rather than weekly/monthly?
A18: Daily returns provide optimal granularity for equity analysis.
    
    ADVANTAGES:
    - Maximum data points: ~500 observations over 2 years
    - Captures short-term volatility: Important for risk metrics
    - Standard practice: Industry norm for equity analysis
    - Real-time relevance: Matches trading frequency
    
    ALTERNATIVES:
    - Weekly returns: Fewer observations, less precise
    - Monthly returns: Too few data points (~24 observations)
    - Intraday returns: Too noisy, not relevant for long-term investors
    
    STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
    - Central Limit Theorem: More observations = better estimates
    - Volatility clustering: Daily data captures this phenomenon
    - Autocorrelation: Minimal in daily equity returns

================================================================================
SECTION 7: LIMITATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS
================================================================================

Q19: What are the key limitations of our analysis?
A19: Several important limitations should be considered:

    - Efficient markets: Prices reflect available information
    - Continuous trading: No gaps or illiquidity issues
    - Normal market conditions: No extreme stress periods
    
    RISK MODEL ASSUMPTIONS:
    - VaR assumes: Historical distribution predicts future
    - Correlation assumes: Linear relationships persist
    - Volatility assumes: Past volatility predicts future volatility
    
    PORTFOLIO ASSUMPTIONS:
    - Rebalancing: Perfect and costless rebalancing
    - Divisibility: Can buy fractional shares
    - No constraints: No regulatory or practical limitations

================================================================================
SECTION 8: PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
================================================================================

Q21: How should investors use these metrics in practice?
A21: These metrics provide a framework for investment decision-making:
    
    PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION:
    - Use correlation matrix to identify diversification opportunities
    - Target Sharpe ratios >1.0 for risk-adjusted performance
    - Consider maximum drawdown for risk tolerance assessment
    - Use beta for market exposure management
    
    RISK MANAGEMENT:
    - VaR for position sizing (don't risk more than you can afford)
    - Maximum drawdown for stop-loss decisions
